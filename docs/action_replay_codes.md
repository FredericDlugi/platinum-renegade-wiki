# Action Replay Codes

## General
These are some Action Replay codes which might be helpful to make the game play a bit faster.
Please note that the Game ID is different to the original Platinum. You can find this value out with the R4 Cheat Code Editor program if you need it.
These can also be applied to the ROM as an additional patch which is supplied with the download.

## Instant Text
This code will make all text appear instantly instead of a gradual scroll.
Please note that it will stop you hearing certain fanfares (e.g. the sound effect after an evolution).

## Gauge Animation Cut
This code will make it so HP bars drop instantly instead of gradually.
Please note that it won't have any effect until the HP bars are over a certain value, so the effect won't be immediately apparent early on.
