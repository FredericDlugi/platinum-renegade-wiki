# Type Changes

## General Changes

- fairy-type is now in the game, replacing what was previously the ??? type.
- All Pokémon that are fairy-type in Gen VI onwards are also fairy-type in Renegade Platinum. This is true for the Complete and the Classic versions.
- Rotom's five alternate forms take the secondary type that they have in the Gen V games and onward (i.e. they are not ghost-type like the normal Platinum).
- For other type changes, they are only present in the Complete version of the hack. If you don't like these changes, use the Classic version patch instead.
