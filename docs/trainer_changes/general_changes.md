## General Changes

- Trainer rosters in every area has been modified. They are all listed below with species and levels.
- Important trainers have their entire roster listed including species, levels, items, moves and natures.
- Natures have not been set for all Trainers - if a '?' is listed where the nature should be then it hasn't been specifically set.
- Some postgame Trainers have a * next to their name. This signals that you need to beat them to advance into Stark Mountain.
- Some trainers have a (!) next to their name. This means that they have further rosters via the Vs. Seeker.
- Some trainers have a (3) or other number next to their name. This means they should start using these teams once you have that number of badges.
- Instead of a number, you may see a (C) for Champion or (S) for Stark Mountain, which means after completing these they'll gain those teams.
- Please note that the number of badges may not always be correct. Feel free to report any incorrect information!
